Function	Detail & Integrity Impact																								
Batch Caching (P0​)	Before transmission, the CA commits the data to a persistent local cache. This action is the fundamental mechanism for preventing data loss (Issue 5), as the data can always be retrieved and resubmitted after any detected failure.																								
Merkle Root Generation (MRClient​)	The CA calculates the MRClient​, a cryptographic hash that uniquely seals the entire batch's content and order. This root is transmitted with the data and serves as the irreputable proof of the data's original state that the server must match.																								
Final Acknowledgment Gate	The CA completely ignores the initial, unreliable HTTP success code from the HEC. It operates a strict gate, awaiting the final, cryptographically backed SUCCESS or FAILURE instruction from the SA. This resolves Issue 4 (Ack ID delay and loss) by decoupling delivery assurance from network-level acknowledgment.																								
Intelligent Self-Healing (IS−RLA)	If a FAILURE is received, the CA uses its learned policy (based on the type of failure and retry history) to execute an optimized resend strategy. This intelligent back-off avoids the "thundering herd" problem, minimizes the total downtime, and contributes to resolving Issue 6 (Reconciliation time delay).																								
Proactive Stability Check (IS−RLA)	Upon receiving data, the SA's policy observes the indexer's health (SServer​). If the IS−RLA predicts a high probability of failure (e.g., due to overload or known instabilities), it issues a pre-emptive FAILURE instruction. This is the first line of defense against Issue 6 (Reconciliation delay), saving valuable processing time.																								
Post-Indexing Hashing (MRServer​ & H′)	The data is indexed, and then the SA calculates two critical hashes from the indexed data: 1) The MRServer​ (batch hash) and 2) the individual event hash H′. This confirms what was actually committed to the indexer.																								
Final Cryptographic Verification	The SA executes the protocol's core integrity check: MRServer​=?MRClient​.																								
* If they do not match, it proves that the data was corrupted, parsed incorrectly, or reordered during the indexing pipeline. This resolves Issues 1 & 3 (Parsing and Chronological Issues), forcing a retry of the original batch.																									
BA Query Service	The SA queries the BA using H′ to check for past successful indexing of the same event. This external, immutable check is the final safeguard against Issue 2 (Duplication) before the transaction is finalized.																								
Verdict Commitment	The SA is the only agent that communicates the final, verifiable SUCCESS or FAILURE verdict to both the CA (for healing) and the BA (for permanent logging).																								
Immutable Ledger Construction	The BA chains all integrity records (the SA's final verdict + cryptographic hashes) using techniques like Merkle Trees or hash chaining. Each new record cryptographically relies on the previous one, making the historical log tamper-proof.																								
Permanent Status Storage (Issue 7 Resolution)	By logging the SA's final verdict to a permanent chain, the BA ensures that the status of an event batch never expires. This resolves Issue 7 (Expiry of status information), providing a definitive audit trail for any compliance query years later.																								
Duplication Verification Service	The BA provides the query service for the SA. The BA's simple, reliable answer ("YES, this hash exists in a SUCCESS record" or "NO") serves as the final, immutable evidence needed to resolve Issue 2 (Duplication), allowing the SA to make an informed, non-contradictory decision.																								
Non-Repudiation	The entire ledger ensures that the SA's integrity process is fully transparent and auditable. The records provide verifiable proof to external auditors that the protocol worked as intended.
