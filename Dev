DriftLens-XAI is an explainable AI-based framework designed to proactively monitor and mitigate model drift within banking systems. It addresses three critical drift types—feature drift, bias drift, and concept drift—by combining statistical detection with explainable diagnostics. Using techniques like SHAP, counterfactual analysis, and PSI/KL-divergence, DriftLens-XAI not only flags model degradation but also explains why it’s happening and who it impacts. It incorporates a self-healing loop that suggests retraining, reweighting, or escalation. Built for compliance-heavy environments, this system enables internal stakeholders—model validators, auditors, and risk teams—to ensure continuous model trustworthiness, fairness, and performance across evolving banking data landscapes.
DriftLens-XAI is a next-gen explainable AI framework built to detect and address model drift in banking systems before it becomes a risk. It focuses on three key types of drift—feature, bias, and concept—using a blend of statistical methods and interpretable AI techniques like SHAP values, counterfactual analysis, and PSI/KL-divergence. Unlike traditional drift monitors, DriftLens-XAI doesn’t just raise red flags—it explains why a model is failing and who it affects. With a built-in self-healing loop, it can suggest retraining strategies, adjust feature weights, or escalate critical issues. Designed for regulatory environments, it empowers model validators, auditors, and risk teams to maintain trust, fairness, and transparency as data and conditions evolve.
