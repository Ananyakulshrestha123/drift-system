DriftLens-XAI is an explainable AI-based framework designed to proactively monitor and mitigate model drift within banking systems. It addresses three critical drift types—feature drift, bias drift, and concept drift—by combining statistical detection with explainable diagnostics. Using techniques like SHAP, counterfactual analysis, and PSI/KL-divergence, DriftLens-XAI not only flags model degradation but also explains why it’s happening and who it impacts. It incorporates a self-healing loop that suggests retraining, reweighting, or escalation. Built for compliance-heavy environments, this system enables internal stakeholders—model validators, auditors, and risk teams—to ensure continuous model trustworthiness, fairness, and performance across evolving banking data landscapes.
