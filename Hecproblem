Problem Statement

When sending data to Splunk, the HTTP Event Protocol is used for data transmission from clients to the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) on the Splunk server. The HEC responds with a success message Le HTTP status code 200 when error-free data is received. But this doesn't ensure that the data is indexed to their database as Splunk uses a separate processing pipeline for indexing and the status code is sent before data enters this pipeline. Fallures during indexing leads to data integrity issue in Splunk. These are due to outage, system failures, server issues, network issues, transmission errors, etc

Splunk do provide a solution called Indexer Acknowledgement for outages and system failures. An Ack10 it passed in the response message to the client along with the HTTP status code 200 when HEC receives the data. The client will then send separate request with a list of such Acks and the HEC will respond back stating true if the

data corresponding to these IDs were replicated Here are the current challenges in indeser Acknowledgement

(A) Data loss during transdes - The True status only means that data is replicated to other indesers. There is still no guarantee if data wat Indexed, as anything that can't be parsed will get dropped

Data duplication- Checking for the status before indesing completes will receive a false Repeated checking for lack of clanty will also receive a "false" after an initial "True This leads to unnecessary rmend of events

Unknown Status Expiry of status saved on HEC due to chennel deanup or cache clearance before the client requests the indesing

(D) Chronotingical lasses The ordering of events change during resend of data and cause issues when analyzing status Changel Pustory, etc

(1) Multiple mursts her une ruent - The reconcilation-based pric requires an initiat sending request and another querying request



Technical Solution

The proposed system introduces a fingerprint-first, Af assisted blockchain verified ingestion pipeline for Splunk HTTP Event Collector Instead of

considering only indexing of events directly on the Spunk file system, an immutable ledger is created by the consensus of participating indesers SHA-256 The sending application hashes an event and sends it to any indexer in the receiving cluster. That indexer must individually attempt to index the event to a central file system and additionally the active Al agent on it runs a query against the Splunk file system by itself to check the indexing status

The active Al indexer agent triggers a validation process by communicating the unique ID of the event to the other participating Al agent indexers These agent indexers must then attempt to locate the receved event on the common file system by running Splunk queries from their end

A Pos besed consensus is made on the individual query results, Betic example. The number of participating agents can be an odd number to achieve a majority for a consensus. Once the comemus process completes, the result is shared in the respunse to the client If an indexer is found to have wrongly triggered the validation process ov

has wrongly validated the presence of an event, it loses a stakir point The chent need not send a separata query request while it receives a success message just once anit only when there is complete indexing

AlAl agent integrated with the HHC monitors indesing status in near real time. It queries Splunk's indexers for the event fingerprint and applies a concensis algorithm across multiple indexers or nades it prevents error and duplication of an event. The Al can additionally predict future tremuls

Self-Healing Indexing Integrity Protocol (SIIP)
The proposed system introduces a Merkle Root-first, IS-RLA (Intelligent Self-Healing/Reinforcement Learning Agent) assisted, Blockchain-verified ingestion pipeline for the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC). This approach replaces simple indexing logging with a robust, cryptographically guaranteed integrity model distributed across three agents.

1. The Client Agent (CA) - Data Assurance Manager
The sending application is managed by the Client Agent (CA), which implements the primary integrity assurance mechanisms:

Merkle Root Generation: The CA first calculates the Merkle Root Client (MR 
Client
â€‹
 ), a cryptographic fingerprint representing the content and chronological order of the entire event batch. This MR 
Client
â€‹
  is sent along with the events to the HEC.

Persistent Caching: The CA maintains a persistent local cache of the batch until a definitive SUCCESS instruction is received from the Server Agent (SA). This mechanism resolves data loss issues (Issue 5).

2. The Server Agent (SA) - Integrity Validator and Decision Maker
The receiving cluster is managed by the Server Agent (SA-IS-RLA), which sits behind the HEC and enforces validation:

Proactive IS-RLA Check: The active IS-RLA agent within the SA monitors the Indexer's near real-time status (S 
Server
â€‹
 ). It executes a policy to proactively reject the batch (sending a FAILURE instruction back to the CA) if the system state predicts an indexing failure. This prevents unnecessary resource use and minimizes reconciliation delay (Issue 6).

Post-Indexing Verification: Once the event batch is indexed, the SA calculates a second signature, the Merkle Root Server (MR 
Server
â€‹
 ), from the events as they were actually committed to the central file system.

Final Integrity Consensus: The SA performs a non-repudiable check:

Corruption/Chronology Check: It validates MR 
Server
â€‹
  
=
?
 MR 
Client
â€‹
 . A mismatch signals parsing errors or chronological failures (Issues 1 & 3).

Duplication Check: It queries the Blockchain Agent (BA) using the event's unique hash (H 
â€²
 ) to check the immutable ledger for any prior successful indexing (Issue 2).

3. The Blockchain Agent (BA) - Immutable Ledger
The verification step culminates in logging to the Blockchain Agent (BA), which acts as the official, permanent audit ledger:

Immutable Ledger Creation: The BA creates an immutable ledger by hash-chaining the SA's final verdict (SUCCESS/FAILURE) along with the associated MR and H 
â€²
 . This replaces simple file system logging.

Status Guarantee: The ledger ensures that the indexing status of any event is permanent and non-expiring (Issue 7).

4. Self-Healing Closure
Client Response: The client receives a definitive SUCCESS response only when the entire process, including the cryptographic and duplication checks, is completed and logged to the BA.

Intelligent Recovery: If the SA sends a FAILURE instruction (due to proactive rejection, corruption, or duplication), the CA activates its IS-RLA policy to retrieve the cached data and determine the optimal resend time and strategy, closing the self-healing loop.


The novelty of the **Self-Healing Indexing Integrity Protocol (SIIP)** lies in its integration of advanced concepts (RLA, Blockchain, Merkle Trees) to solve data pipeline integrity problems, often by employing non-obvious solutions that reject standard practices.

Here are the seven key novelty points of SIIP, paired with the non-obvious reasoning behind each design choice:

***

## ðŸŒŸ 7 Novelty Points and Non-Obvious Rationale of SIIP

### 1. Proactive Integrity Failure Prediction ($\text{SA-IS-RLA}$)

| Novelty Point | Non-Obvious Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| Integration of an **RLA** into the **Server Agent (SA)** to predict indexing success based on system load ($\text{S}_{\text{Server}}$) *before* committing resources. | It is non-obvious to program a system to **voluntarily fail (reject)** a request. The obvious approach is to queue and wait. This is done to prevent hours of delay and save computational resources by avoiding an inevitable crash, resolving **Issue 6 (Reconciliation Delay)**. |

### 2. End-to-End Cryptographic Chain of Custody

| Novelty Point | Non-Obvious Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hashing the data and comparing signatures ($\mathbf{MR}_{\text{Server}} \stackrel{?}{=} \mathbf{MR}_{\text{Client}}$) **after** the SA has fully indexed and processed the data. | The obvious time to hash is before transport. Hashing the data's **output state** is non-obvious but necessary to catch **internal processing failures** (like **parsing errors, Issue 1**, or **event reordering, Issue 3**) that occur *inside* the server after reception. |

### 3. Guaranteed Delivery via State Decoupling (Data Loss Prevention)

| Novelty Point | Non-Obvious Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| The **Client Agent (CA)** is designed to **ignore the network success code** (e.g., HEC's `200 OK`) and maintain a **persistent cache** until a final, integrity-verified status is received. | It is non-obvious and counter-intuitive to **ignore a valid success response** from the network. This is required because network success is meaningless to data integrity. This design is crucial for resolving **Issue 5 (Data Loss)** and **Issue 4 (Ack ID delay)**. |

### 4. Intelligent Reactive Self-Healing ($\text{CA-IS-RLA}$)

| Novelty Point | Non-Obvious Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| Implementing an **RLA policy** within the **CA** to determine the optimal wait time and strategy when resending data after a detected $\text{FAILURE}$. | The obvious solution is fixed or random exponential backoff. Using an **intelligent agent** to manage retries is non-obvious but prevents the "thundering herd" problem and minimizes resource contention, optimizing the recovery phase. |

### 5. Blockchain as an External Audit Service

| Novelty Point | Non-Obvious Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| Utilizing the **Blockchain Agent (BA)** as an external, immutable ledger specifically for storing the SA's final operational verdict ($\text{SUCCESS}/\text{FAILURE}$) and associated hashes. | The obvious logging solution is a simple database or system log. It is non-obvious to use a cryptographically chained ledger for simple status flags, but it is necessary to establish **non-repudiable proof** for auditing. |

### 6. Permanent Status Guarantee

| Novelty Point | Non-Obvious Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| Guaranteeing that the indexing status of any batch is **non-expiring** through reliance on the BA. | The obvious approach accepts that status information is transient and subject to log rotation/retention policies. The non-obvious commitment to **permanent status storage** on the BA is the direct mechanism required to fully resolve **Issue 7 (Status Expiry)** for compliance needs. |

### 7. Explicit Duplication Veto Power

| Novelty Point | Non-Obvious Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| Making the BA's status ledger the final authority for the **duplication check**, mandating a query from the SA before a $\text{SUCCESS}$ can be logged. | The obvious place to check for duplicates is the operational database. The non-obvious choice is to delegate this critical check to the external, immutable BA. This ensures that the duplication check is based on a **non-manipulable chronological history**, resolving **Issue 2 (Duplication)**. |




## 1. Why Use a Blockchain Agent and Merkle Trees for Hashing?

The combination of the **Blockchain Agent (BA)** and **Merkle Trees (or hash chaining)** is used to establish an **immutable, non-repudiable audit trail** of the Server Agent's (SA) final verdict.

### A. Why the Blockchain Agent (BA)?

The BA serves as the system's **Source of Truth** for integrity status. Its purpose is not to host a full cryptocurrency but to leverage the core principle of blockchain technology: **immutability**.

1.  **Status Non-Expiry (Issue Resolution):** Without the BA, the SA's verdict (SUCCESS/FAILURE) might be stored in a simple database or logs, which can be deleted, expire, or tampered with. The BA permanently records the status of every processed batch to its chain, resolving the issue of **status expiry** and guaranteeing that the data is always auditable.
2.  **Duplication Prevention:** The BA's ledger is the only component the SA can trust to confirm that a specific event has **never before been successfully indexed** (preventing chronological duplication).
3.  **Non-Repudiation:** The BA provides cryptographically verifiable proof to auditors that the SA made a specific decision (SUCCESS/FAILURE) at a specific time.

### B. Why Merkle Trees (or Hash Chaining)?

Merkle Trees and hash chaining are crucial for generating the integrity proofs used by the BA.

1.  **Immutability:** Merkle Trees are used by the BA to link one integrity record to the next. Any attempt to alter an old record would change its hash, which would break the hash of the next record in the chain, exposing the tampering immediately.
2.  **Efficient Verification:** Within a data batch, the Merkle Root ($\text{MR}$) itself is a single hash that efficiently summarizes **all** data in the batch. This allows the SA to verify millions of data points by comparing just two small values ($\text{MR}_{\text{Client}}$ vs. $\text{MR}_{\text{Server}}$) instead of comparing the full data payload. 

***

## 2. Why Do We Need Hashing Before Sending to the Server?

Hashing the data **before** it leaves the Client Agent (CA) is the essential first step in enabling the entire end-to-end integrity protocol. This hash is called the **Merkle Root Client ($\text{MR}_{\text{Client}}$)**.

1.  **Establishing a Baseline of Truth:** The $\text{MR}_{\text{Client}}$ acts as the **irrefutable cryptographic fingerprint** of the data's intended state. It seals the content and the **order** of all events in the batch *at the point of origin*.
2.  **Detecting Corruption and Parsing Errors (Issue 1):** Once the data reaches the server and is indexed, the Server Agent (SA) generates its own hash ($\text{MR}_{\text{Server}}$). If the data was corrupted during transit, had events dropped by the HEC, or was parsed/transformed incorrectly by the indexer, the comparison $\mathbf{MR}_{\text{Client}} \stackrel{?}{=} \mathbf{MR}_{\text{Server}}$ will fail. This comparison is the protocol's primary mechanism for detecting **post-submission integrity loss**.
3.  **Detecting Chronological Issues (Issue 3):** The Merkle Root's structure depends on the exact sequence of events. If the indexer processes the events in the wrong order, the $\text{MR}_{\text{Server}}$ will not match the $\text{MR}_{\text{Client}}$, immediately signaling a **chronological integrity failure**.

Hashing the data *after* transmission would only confirm what the server received, not what the client sent. Pre-submission hashing ties the server to the client's original intent.

***

## 3. What Is the Use of Multiple Agents (CA, SA, BA)?

SIIP uses a multi-agent structure to distribute control, intelligence, and trust, preventing any single point of failure or corruption from compromising the system's integrity guarantee.

| Agent | Core Responsibility | Why a Separate Agent Is Necessary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Client Agent (CA-IS-RLA)** | **Delivery Assurance & Recovery.** Manages the local cache, generates the integrity proof ($\text{MR}_{\text{Client}}$), and executes the $\text{IS-RLA}$ intelligent resend loop. | **Decouples Healing from Indexing.** The client must be solely responsible for data persistence and executing recovery to prevent server overload (thundering herd). |
| **Server Agent (SA-IS-RLA)** | **Integrity Validation & Central Decision.** Calculates the server's proof ($\text{MR}_{\text{Server}}$), performs all integrity checks (corruption, duplication), and issues the final verdict. | **Decouples Trust from Client.** The SA acts as an independent validator, preventing the client from lying about its own data ($\text{MR}_{\text{Client}}$) or blindly trusting the indexer's output. It applies the **proactive intelligence** ($\text{IS-RLA}$). |
| **Blockchain Agent (BA)** | **Immutable Audit Trail & Status Guarantee.** Stores the final verdict in a non-repudiable, permanent ledger. | **Decouples Auditability from Operations.** By keeping the status log separate from the operational agents (CA, SA), the log remains secure, non-expiring, and trusted by external auditors, fulfilling the core mandate of *non-repudiation*. |
