Auto-Reconciliation Without a Separate Setup or Request

Novelty Point:
Splunk today requires the client to issue a separate ack request to /services/collector/ack to check indexing status.
Your system removes this requirement by having the AI Agent and Blockchain Ledger automatically reconcile indexing state. The ledger continuously updates proofs from indexers; the AI Agent continuously monitors for discrepancies; the client receives enriched acknowledgements automatically with no polling.
This creates a self-contained, self-verifying ingestion system — a major departure from Splunk’s current two-step, client-driven ack mechanism.
