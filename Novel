1. Self-Healing Consensus

Why Novel:
Current Splunk deployments rely on static replication and acknowledgement policies. If an indexer fails or lags, Splunk waits for manual intervention or static timeouts. There is no built-in mechanism for an agent to dynamically adjust quorum thresholds or re-route events.
Our proposal introduces a blockchain-based consensus layer monitored by an Active AI Agent. The AI Agent constantly analyses indexer health metrics and automatically recalculates quorum or substitutes nodes when failures are predicted or detected. This enables real-time, self-healing consensus that maintains ingestion and verification continuity without human intervention. Splunk does not provide such an autonomous, agent-driven mechanism today.

2. Managing Timestamp for Lost Events

Why Novel:
By default, when a lost event is resent to Splunk, it is treated as a new event and given a new _time (or relies on the time of replay). This distorts dashboards and time-series analysis because the chronological order is lost.
Our system captures the original event timestamp at first receipt, stores it immutably in the blockchain ledger along with the fingerprint, and automatically re-applies this timestamp during replay. As a result, dashboards and searches remain chronologically accurate even after replays, which Splunk’s current system cannot guarantee.

3. Managing Duplication of Events

Why Novel:
Splunk’s acknowledgement mechanism does not cryptographically identify events. When a client resends an event because of a lost ACK, Splunk will treat it as a completely new event, leading to duplication and skewed analytics.
Our proposal generates a cryptographic hash (fingerprint) of the full event including its timestamp, making it a globally unique ID. Before any replay, the AI Agent checks the ledger and indexers for the fingerprint. If it already exists, replay is prevented. This ensures true idempotent ingestion and eliminates duplicates without needing external scripts — a capability Splunk currently lacks.

4. Active Indexer AI Agent

Why Novel:
Splunk’s built-in acknowledgement only reports replication status; it does not include intelligence or predictive capabilities. Existing consensus algorithms can coordinate nodes but cannot predict future ingestion issues or adjust parameters dynamically.
Our Active Indexer AI Agent goes further by learning from historical ingestion patterns, predicting latency or failures, dynamically tuning verification frequency and quorum thresholds, orchestrating replays with original timestamps, and maintaining a unified view of all indexers. This adds a predictive, self-optimising layer above Splunk’s ingestion pipeline that no existing product or patent currently offers.
